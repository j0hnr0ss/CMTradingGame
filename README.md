Buy and sell stocks to grow your portfolio value and beat your opponents by having the most money at the end of the game


Note: this game requires multiple players in order for prices to be set and matched. It uses fictional companies with fictional prices as set up by the administrator. Players can place both buy and sell orders which will get matched with other players' orders.

How gameplay works:
On the New Order tab, select the stock, quantity and price that you want to trade at and click on either Buy or Sell

As long as the stock hasn't traded or only partially traded, you can cancel your order by clicking on the X next to the order

The Filled column shows how many of your order (Quantity) has been matched/traded in the market

Refer to the Portfolio Analytics table to see what the last traded price of the stocks were, your price has to be within a 50% range of the last price. No negative values are possible

On the Exchange tab you can see what the highest offers (sell) and lowest bids (buy) are for each share, these are the values that your colleagues are willing to trade at

Also on the Exchange tab you can see which fund is currently in the lead

Refer to the Portfolio tab where you can see which stocks you are currently invested in, how much cash is in your fund and what your total portfolio value is

Note that your investors are penalizing your fund for having too much cash; they don't want you to have any more than 10.000 euros in cash and for every euro you have over that, they expect 5% "interest"

Your investors want to diversify their portfolio and will offer a bonus of 10.000 if you have at least 5% of each stock

You have secured a credit facility from your local lender. Your fund can therefore have a negative cash balance, however the lender charges 10% interest

It is possible to short stock, a margin account of 50% of the short value will automatically be opened (and subtracted from cash) which bears an interest of 4%
